## Construct.js

Construct.js is a framework to create WebGL apps using a variety of open-source libs. 

This is the main constructor library. 

## Features 

* Modular architecture
* WebGL rendering
* Gamepad / Touchscreen inputs

Construct acts more as a Dependency Injection framework, assisting the app and setting the ground work so all the needed classes are available for instantiation. 

For that reason it is assumed that only one instance of the construct is required for any web page, and instantiation construct as a class is considered out of scope.
